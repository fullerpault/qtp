# Querying the Past

In 2016, [Dr. Wendy Chapkis](https://usm.maine.edu/directories/people/wendy-chapkis/) (USM Professor of Sociology and Women & Gender Studies) was appointed Faculty Scholar for the Jean Byers Sampson Center’s LGBTQ+ Collection. In that capacity, she created the *Querying the Past: Maine LGBTQ Oral History Project*.

Each fall, Professor Chapkis trains cohorts of USM students in oral history methods and matches them with members of the Maine LGBTQ community (“narrators”) for 60 to 90 minute interviews. The voices and stories of our community are thus preserved and made available as a resource for scholars and the public.

## Digital Archive
These interviews are archived in the [LGBTQ+ Collection](https://usm.maine.edu/special-collections/research/lgbtq-collection/) at the [Jean Byers Sampson Center for Diversity in Maine](https://usm.maine.edu/special-collections/research/sampson-center/), part of [Special Collections](https://usm.maine.edu/special-collections/) at the University of Southern Maine. A digital archive of the interviews is available on [USM Digital Commons](https://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/querying_ohproject/).

## Querying the Past Exhibit Website
This exhibit website was built by Digital Projects Staff with help from Dr. Chapkis, and Elizabeth Lowell. This website provides an easier way to browse the interviews, discover connections, and dive more deeply into the material.
